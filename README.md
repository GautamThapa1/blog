# Django Blog Project

This is a simple blog app I built while following the **"Django for Beginners"** book by William S. Vincent. It helped me understand how Django works, especially things like models, views, templates, and user authentication.

## What it does

- Shows a list of blog posts
- Lets you click into each post to read more
- Has a login and signup system
- Lets logged-in users add, edit, and delete posts
- Comes with a built-in admin panel

## Tech Used

- Python
- Django
- SQLite (default database)
- HTML/CSS

## How to run it

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog.git
cd blog
